## CLEAN IT UP

## Sunway Make It Challenge 2022

## Introduction
As part of the organized hackathon by my university to promote the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, I created this game that spreads awareness and educates users about environmental issues and climatic changes in an engaging way.

## Game Functionality
The objective of the game is to dispose of all the waste in the correct bins. Items are thrown from the top and users need to catch and collect the items in the right bin. A point system is implemented, each item that is correctly collected awards the users +5 points. -1 for items going in the wrong bin and -3 points are awarded if the items get thrown on the floor.
